**Question: Does the percent of GDP from natural resources affect countries' corruption levels?**

Hypothesis: The percentage of GDP from natural resources has an effect countries' corruption levels

Null hypothesis: The percent of GDP from natural resources has no effect on countries' corruption levels

## Sources

### Corruption Perception Index

Our data comes from two different sources. The first source is for our corruption level data. We used a dataset from *Transparency International*, an organization that works to fight corruption worldwide. The organization has many facets, including a think tank, a UNESCO consultant, and is involved in the UN.

They created a corruption perceptions index, which measures levels of corruption in 180 countries around the world from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). Transparency International takes data from 13 sources, such as banks, think tanks, and research advisory firms around the world. Each of these organizations ask leading experts in their field multiple questions that can be used to gage corruption levels. Some sources only cover specific regions or continents, while others cover the majority of the world. Transparency International then takes the information and standardizes it on a scale of zero to one hundred,"this standardisation is done by subtracting the mean of each source in the baseline year from each country score and then dividing by the standard deviation of that source in the baseline year [and]... ...transformed to the CPI scale by multiplying with the value of the CPI standard deviation in 2012 (20) and adding the mean of CPI in 2012 (45), so that the data set fits the CPIâ€™s 0-100 scale" (CPI report short methodology 2021). They then calculate the average for each country to find their published score.

#### Limitations of the data

The data itself, as well as the way I use it comes with some caveats. Firstly, Transparency International uses varying organizations to get these scores, which in turn use varying methods to get their scores. Although the scores are then standardized, it is still not a completely equal comparison for every single country. In my statistical analysis, I use this corruption **perception** index as a true corruption index for each country. There are clearly limitations to what anyone can truly know about the country in their country, and this index simply measures perceptions for that very reason, but for the purposes of my calculations I treat these numbers as true and fair values. In order to simplify my analysis, I am also not including the standard errors for these values, which could potentially oversimplify the results of the index.

### Percent of GDP from Natural Resources

The natural resource data comes from the World Bank Group, 



```{r}
#| collapse: true
#|code-fold: true
#|output: false
#|quiet: true
# read in libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
```


```{r}
# read in data
corruption <- read_csv(here("data", "2021_corruption.csv"))

natural_resources <- read_csv(here("data", "natural_resources.csv"))
```

### Clean up the data

Our data comes from multiple sources. In order to join the corruption and natural resources datasets together, it's crucial that we make sure that all the information is clean and lines up. 

```{r}
# Take our the rows that doesn't contain data from countries
natural_resources <- natural_resources[1:217, ]

# Join the data together
corrupt_resource <- full_join(corruption, natural_resources, by = c("Country / Territory" = "Country"))

# Rename the country column for clarity and clean up names
corrupt_resource_clean <- corrupt_resource |> 
  rename("country" = "Country / Territory") |> 
  clean_names() 

# Select the columns we're interested in
corrupt_resource_select <- corrupt_resource_clean |> 
  select(country, iso3, cpi_score_2021,total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp, oil_rents_percent_of_gdp, natural_gas_rents_percent_of_gdp, coal_rents_percent_of_gdp, mineral_rents_percent_of_gdp, forest_rents_percent_of_gdp)

# Change CPI score data to numeric so we can work with it
corrupt_resource_select$cpi_score_2021 <- as.numeric(corrupt_resource_select$cpi_score_2021)

# Change total natural resource data to numeric as well
corrupt_resource_select$total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp <- as.numeric(corrupt_resource_select$total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp)
```

### Make a preliminary plot

```{r}
# Plot the data
first_plot <- ggplot(corrupt_resource_select, aes(x=total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp, y = cpi_score_2021)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("percent of GDP from natural resources") +
  ylab("corruption perception index") +
  labs(title = "Natural Resource's affect on countries' corruption levels") +
  theme_grey() 

first_plot
```

At first glance, our data doesn't really look correlated at all. But let's dive a little deeper. 

```{r}
# Run linear regression summary
summary(lm(cpi_score_2021 ~ total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp, data = corrupt_resource_select))
```

There are a few numbers here that are of interest to us. First let's look at the intercept and the total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp (the slope). According to our model, if our hypothetical country had no GDP resulting from natural resources, then the corruption level would be at 48. We could maybe buy this if we hadn't looked at the graph, but when we look at our data points visually it looks like our intercept is really just halfway in between our huge cluster of points around zero that seem to be evenly dispersed on the y axis. When looking at the slope we can also see that it's very small. Each percentage point increase in GDP results in a less than 1 index level decrease. 

The p-values for both our intercept and slope are very small. Our intercept is less than .000000000000000002 (essentially zero for our purposes) and our slope has a p-value of .000106, also a very small number. Both are far below .05, the number needed for a value to be statistically significant. So if these values are both statistically significant, why do I still not trust that it's meaningful?

Let's look at adjusted R squared value. It's about 0.09. R squared is always a value from 0 to 1, where 0 means that the model explains essentially zero percent of the change in y, and 1 means that the model is the perfect fit and the variable explains 100 percent of the change in y. Our value is less than .1, essentially meaning that the percent of GDP from natural resources explains less than 1 percent of the corruption levels in countries. So our model is statistically significant but explains very very little of corruption levels. 

This makes sense when we look at our graph with our best fit line. If we squint at the graph, we can *maybe* see a correlation, but it's certainly a stretch. The graph, along with our linear model summary, makes us think that there is definitely omitted variable bias here.

```{r}
smooth_plot <- ggplot(corrupt_resource_select, aes(x=total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp, y = cpi_score_2021)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("percent of GDP from natural resources") +
  ylab("corruption perception index") +
  labs(title = "Natural Resource's affect on countries' corruption levels") +
  theme_grey() +
geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x,
              se = FALSE,
              method = lm)
smooth_plot
```

### Let's regroup and think about what other variables could be contributing to corruption levels. 

My new theory is that the type of government could be a major contributing factor in corruption levels. My theory is that countries with more democracy are less corrupt. More closed a government is, the more that invites corruption in. Let's load in another dataset that has information on political regimes worldwide. 

#### About this data


```{r}
regime <- read_csv(here("data", "political-regime.csv"))

regime_clean <- regime |> 
  rename("country" = "Entity") |> 
  clean_names() 

# Replace numeric values with descriptive labels
regime_clean <- regime_clean %>%
  mutate(political_regime = case_when(
    political_regime == 0 ~ "closed_autocracies",
    political_regime == 1 ~ "electoral_autocracies",
    political_regime == 2 ~ "electoral_democracies",
    political_regime == 3 ~ "liberal_democracies"
  ))

corrupt_nat_dem <- full_join(corrupt_resource_select, regime_clean, by = c("iso3" = "code"))


corrupt_nat_dem_select <- corrupt_nat_dem[1:180, ] |> 
  select(-country.y, -time, -year)

ggplot(corrupt_nat_dem_select, aes(x = total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp, y = cpi_score_2021, color = political_regime)) +
  geom_point() +
   xlab("percent of GDP from natural resources") +
  ylab("corruption perception index") +
  labs(title = "Natural Resource's affect on countries' corruption levels",
       color = "Political regime") +
  theme_grey()


summary(lm(total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp ~ cpi_score_2021 + political_regime +cpi_score_2021:political_regime, data = corrupt_nat_dem_select))

summary(lm(cpi_score_2021 ~ political_regime, data = corrupt_nat_dem_select))

ggplot(corrupt_nat_dem_select, aes(x = political_regime, y = cpi_score_2021)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(corrupt_nat_dem_select, aes(x = political_regime, y = cpi_score_2021)) +
  geom_col() 
```

```{r}
ggplot(corrupt_nat_dem_select, aes(x = total_natural_resources_rents_percent_of_gdp, y = cpi_score_2021, color = political_regime)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~political_regime) 
  
```
